## Living City

A *Mobile Tour Guide* cross-platform app built with Flutter.

This project was developed as part of my Master of Science in Computer Science and Management degree, as a sustainable solution to the problem of overcrowding in the Santa Maria Maior district in Lisbon.

It is a prototype mobile app that provides tourists with sustainable walking tour recommendations. Here are some screenshots:
